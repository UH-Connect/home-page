<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>

We aim to introduce employers to talented  UH students, as well as give students the positions they deserve in their career.

Our app is that bridge that connects the two parties. Modern career apps such as Indeed allow very little interaction. We wanted to make it easier for the two parties to message each other quickly and show interest much more easily.

<h2>User Guide</h2>

<h3>Getting Started<h3>

Upon reaching our pages, you'll be greeted with the following landing page.

<img src="doc/landing.png">

You'll need an account to use our site's content.

By clicking the "sign up" button, you'll be transferred to the following sign-up page. Here you can create a username and password.

<img src="doc/signup.png">

By signing up, you can access the account in the future. If you are not signed in on the landing page, you can click the "sign in" dropdown on the top right corner of the navbar.

<img src="doc/signin-nav.png">

This will lead you to the following page. Here instead of registering your account, you will be asked to put your password in.

<img src="doc/signin.png">

Your first time signing in, you will be asked to select a role. (Note: placeholder image)

<img src="doc/landing-norole.png">

By clicking on the "Select Role" button, you'll be redirected to the role select page. On this page, you'll be able to choose whether you wish to continue as a student or a company.

Don't worry, this can be changed later.

If you choose to continue as a student, you will be greeted with the following landing page. (Note: placeholder image)

<img src="doc/landing-student.png">

From here, you will gain access to job listings and profile editing. These features can be accessed on the navbar as well as near the bottom of the screen.

The profile editing page looks like this. This will create, or edit, a profile for employers to view. The employers can save these contacts.

If you choose to continue as a company, you will be greeted with the following landing page. (Note: placeholder image)

<img src="doc/landing-company.png">

From here, you will gain access to job listings, just like the students. You will also gain access to add jobs and recruiting.

Adding a job allows students to view it and save it.

<img src="doc/add-job.png">

There is also a different landing page for admins. Admins have access to both the job listings as well as student profile viewing.

<h3>More Information</h3>

At the bottom of the page, you can find the footer with several links.

<img src="doc/footer.png">

The first of these links is the FAQ. It gives a list of frequently asked questions.

The second of these links is our project homepage. It simply brings the user back to this page.

The third leads to our GitHub page.

The one in the middle brings the user back to the landing page.

The fourth button brings the user to the About page. It gives an overview of our app.

<img src="doc/footer-about.png">

The fifth page is the Get Started page. This page is still a work in progress.

The sixth page is the terms of service page. It is a brief overview of expected behavior while using our app.

<h2>Developer Guide</h2>

In order for UH-Connect to run, I will list all the software needed.

* MeteorJS
* Terminal
* NodeJS (Version: Node v12)
* Node Version Manager (Use NVM, you might need to change Node versions occasionally)

Once all of these are installed, Go into your terminal (or Powershell, etc...), and go into the app folder.
Once in the app folder, then run the command ```meteor npm install```. This will install all the dependencies needed for the app to run. Then you run the command ```meteor npm run start```, this will take start to run the app, and give you a link to the app.

<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the Scenes</h2>

Our App runs on multiple layers of technology:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> is how our project base code is created</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com//">Digital Ocean</a> for hosting our website app</li>
</ul>
