<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>

We aim to introduce employers to talented  UH students, as well as give students the positions they deserve in their career.

Our app is that bridge that connects the two parties. Modern career apps such as Indeed allow very little interaction. We wanted to make it easier for the two parties to message each other quickly and show interest much more easily.

<h2>User Guide</h2>

Once you load up the page, you are greeted with the Landing Page. Currently, we have accounts and roles all setup, as well as the Jobs collection. On signup, you will be redirected to the role assignment page, where you can change your role to either to 'student' or 'company'. Student roles have access to all the Jobs in the Job database. For company roles, you only have access to your Jobs that you posted on Jobs Collection. Note, that based on your role you will see the webpage differently. To post a Job onto our website, you can either follow the tutorial (still being implemented) or press on the Add Job link on the NavBar. If you ever, want to change your role the role assignment page will still be open, even if you are already assigned one, however, you can only be assigned either student or company. Note that Jobs collection is still a work in progress, we are using this collection to test some of our pages.

<h2>Developer Guide</h2>

In order for UH-Connect to run, I will list all the software needed.

* MeteorJS
* Terminal
* NodeJS (Version: Node v12)
* Node Version Manager (Use NVM, you might need to change Node versions occasionally)

Once all of these are installed, Go into your terminal (or Powershell, etc...), and go into the app folder.
Once in the app folder, then run the command ```meteor npm install```. This will install all the dependencies needed for the app to run. Then you run the command ```meteor npm run start```, this will take start to run the app, and give you a link to the app.

<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the Scenes</h2>

Our App runs on multiple layers of technology:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> is how our project base code is created</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com//">Digital Ocean</a> for hosting our website app</li>
</ul>
